<li>gyana svaroopancha hareradhinam sharira sanyoga viyoga yogyam
anum hi jeevam prati deha bhinnam, gyatritva vantam yadananta mahu</li>
</ol>
<p>Jeev (Chit) is endless and is in the form of knowledge and is knowledgeable too. Meeting with the body and departing from the body is its birth –death. This atomic sized Jeev is different in each body but is ever subservient to “HARI”</p>

<li>anadi maya pari yukta roopam, tvenam vidurvai bhagavatprasadat
 muktancha baddham kila baddhamuktam, prabheda bahulya mathapi bodhyam</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not known since when “MAYA” has been after Jeev. The conjunction with MAYA, which is beginingless, is the reason why Jeev is unable to recognise the from of the PARAMATMA. When the Lord graces, then alone one can get rid of MAYA and obtain the knowledge of the Lord. Though Jeev is of many types, they can be classified mainly as one who is</p>
<p>a) Baddha_ one who is totally immersed in this world of Maya
b) Baddha Mukta – One who has obtained liberation by Bhakti
c) Nitya Mukta – One who has been ever liberated, never coming under the influence of  Maya</p>

<li>apakritam prakrit roopakancha, kala svaroopam tadchetanam matam

</ol>
<p>Aprakrit- The Chit form of God etc. Prakrit= Prakriti – meaning Universe. Universe, its work and Time are all without awareness (Achit) . Maya  as Primary, unmanifested etc are also names of Universe. ; White, Blood and golden yellow coloured Sattvic , Rajasic and Tamasic qualities also belong to  Universe.</p>

<li><p>svabhavato apaasta- samasta dosham sesha kalyan gunaika- rashim
vyohanginam brahm param varenyam, dhyayem krishnam kamalekshanam harim</p>
<p>One who is an ocean of good qualities but is not tainted by any fault of Prakriti and form part of the four Vyuhas (Divine forms) Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradhyumna and Aniruddha . One who is Lotus eyed, the saviour of devotees from sins and faults, the One who is worthy of service to be done unto, that Parabrahm ShriKrishna we meditate upon.</p>

<li>ange tuvaame vrishabhanujam muda, virajamana manu roopasoubhagam
 sakhi sahastraihi pari sevitam sada, smarem devim sakaleashta kamadam</li>
</ol>
<p>Beautiful and sweet like Shri Krishna, seated alongside on the left, served by thousands of sakhis, she (Shri Kishori Radha) who grants all the wishes, we meditate upon her.</p>
<ol>
<li>upasaniyaam nitram janayhi sada, prahannaye agyana tamo anuvratte
sanandadhyir munibhisthoktam, shrinaradayakhila tatva sakshine</li>
</ol>
<p>One should constantly dwell and meditate on this Yugal (Dual) form of Parabrahm – Shri Radhakrishna. Mere concentrating on them dissolves ignorance. Our Shri Nimabrkacharya’s foremost guru ShriSanakadi rishis had bestowed this very same knowledge to Gurudev Shri Narada.</p>

<li>sarvamhi vigyan matoyatharthakam, sruthi smritibhyo nikhilasya vastunaha
 brahmatma katvaditi vedavinmatam, triroopata apisrutisutra sadhita</li>
</ol>
<p>Achit- Chit and visible is this Universe and is in the form of Brahm, as stated by the Saashtras. Since it is the essence of Brahm , it is also a reality (true). The trinity of Bhokta (Enjoyer) , Bhogya (That which is enjoyed) and the Inspiration (cause)  as stated in the Srutis and texts also are to be taken as a reality.</p>
<ol>
<li>nanya gatihi krishna paadaravindat, sandrishyate brahmashivadi vanditat
bhaktechyo pattasuchintya vigrahad chintya shakteravi chintya sashayat</li>
</ol>
<p>One whose extent of strength and meaning is unknowable, even then One who takes many Avatars due to the wishes of devotees. There is no other refuge other than the lotus feet of Shri Radhakrishna  for the grief ridden Jeevas  other than One who is deified by Brahma , Shiva and other Gods.</p>
<ol>
<li>kripasya  dainyadiyuji prajayate, yaya bhavetpremvisesha lakshna
 bhaktirhyananyadhi pater mahatmanaha , sa chottama sadhana roopika apara</li>
</ol>
<p>One who has the qualities of humility etc., the Lord graces only them. Because of this grace alone the Love specific bhakti of the One and only owner Shri Sarveshvar Prabhu is obtained. This bhakti alone is the exalted bhakti. Reciting names of the Lord, singing kirtans and conducting rituals is known as Apara Bhakti.</p>
<ol>
<li>upasya roopam tadupasakasya cha, kripaphalam bhaktirasas tataha param
virodhino roopam thaitadhapte gyerya ime-artha api pancha sadhubhi</li>
</ol>
<p>The Sadhus (Monks) ( Upasak – seeker) should clearly understand  the following five –that which  he seeks (Upasya), the seeker himself, the fruits of grace of Bhagavat, the nectar of Bhakti and realisation of Bhagavat and finally the opponents of Bhakti.</p>
